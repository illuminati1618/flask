# ✅ Authentication Detection Fixed!

## 🔍 What Was The Problem?

The social media page couldn't detect you were logged in because:

**Frontend was checking:** `/api/person/get` ❌  
**Backend actually has:** `/api/id` ✅

**Result:** Even when logged in, the page thought you weren't!

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

Changed both `post.md` and `feed.md` to use the correct endpoint:

```javascript
// BEFORE (Wrong endpoint):
const response = await fetch(`${javaURI}/api/person/get`, fetchOptions);

// AFTER (Correct endpoint):
const response = await fetch(`${javaURI}/api/id`, fetchOptions);
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### **Step 1: Refresh Your Frontend**

If you have the social media page open, **refresh the page** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R).

The frontend needs to reload with the updated code.

### **Step 2: Login Again**

1. Make sure you're logged in with:
   - **Username:** `testuser`
   - **Password:** `123456`

2. Go to the social media page: `/social-media`

### **Step 3: Try Creating a Post**

Now the "Create Post" button should work! The login warning should disappear.

## 🎯 What Should Happen Now

### **When NOT Logged In:**
- ⚠️ Login warning shows: "You must be logged in to create posts or reply"
- 🔒 Submit button is disabled
- ✅ You can still VIEW posts

### **When Logged In:**
- ✅ No login warning
- ✅ Submit button is enabled
- ✅ You can create posts
- ✅ You can reply to posts
- ✅ You can view all posts

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Still says I need to login"

**Fix:**
1. **Hard refresh** the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Clear cache** and refresh
3. **Logout and login again**
4. Make sure you copied the updated `.md` files to your frontend repo

### "Can view posts but can't create"

**Fix:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for errors
3. Check if you see: `Auth check failed`
4. Make sure `javaURI` points to `http://localhost:8587`

### "Getting CORS errors"

**Fix:** Make sure your backend CORS settings allow your frontend domain.

## 📂 Files Updated

1. **`Social Media/post.md`** - Fixed auth check
2. **`Social Media/feed.md`** - Fixed auth check

**Next Step:** Copy these to your frontend repository!

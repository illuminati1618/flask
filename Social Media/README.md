# Social Media Backend - Setup Complete! âœ…

## Files Moved to Backend

The following files have been integrated into your Flask backend:

1. **`model_post.py`** â†’ `model/post.py`
   - Database model for posts and replies
   
2. **`api_post.py`** â†’ `api/post.py`
   - REST API endpoints for posts

3. **`init_posts.py`** â†’ `scripts/init_posts.py`
   - Database initialization script

## Frontend Files

These markdown files are your frontend UI pages:

- **`post.md`** - Create posts and view feed (goes to your frontend repo)
- **`feed.md`** - Social feed viewer (goes to your frontend repo)

## What Was Done

âœ… All backend files copied to correct locations
âœ… `post_api` blueprint registered in `main.py`
âœ… Database initialization added to app startup
âœ… Posts table will be created automatically when backend starts

## API Endpoints Available

Once your backend is running, these endpoints will be available:

- `POST /api/post` - Create a new post (requires auth)
- `GET /api/post/all` - Get all posts (requires auth)
- `GET /api/post/<id>` - Get specific post (requires auth)
- `PUT /api/post/<id>` - Update post (requires auth)
- `DELETE /api/post/<id>` - Delete post (requires auth)
- `POST /api/post/reply` - Reply to a post (requires auth)
- `GET /api/post/user/<user_id>` - Get posts by user (requires auth)
- `GET /api/post/page?url=<url>` - Get posts for a page (public)

## Next Steps

1. **Start your Flask backend** (the posts table will be created automatically)
2. **Copy `post.md` and `feed.md` to your frontend repository**
3. **Test the API** by visiting `http://localhost:8587/api/post/all` (after logging in)
4. **Access social media** from your frontend at the `/social-media` route

## Testing

```bash
# Test if posts API is working
curl http://localhost:8587/api/post/all -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## Integration Complete! ðŸŽ‰

Your social media backend is now fully connected and ready to use!

# README

> This is a project to support AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) as well as a UC articulated Data Structures course. It was crafted iteratively starting in 2020 to the present time.  The primary purposes are ...

- Used as starter code for student projects for `AP CSP 1 and 2` and `Data Structures 1` curriculum.
- Used to teach key principles in learning the Python Flask programming environment.
- Used as a backend server to service API's in a frontend-to-backend pipeline. Review the `api` folder in the project for endpoints.
- Contains a minimal frontend, mostly to support Administrative functionality using the `templates` folder and `Jinja2` to define UIs.
- Contains SQL database code in the `model` folder to introduce concepts of persistent data and storage.  Perisistence folder is `instance/volumes` for generated SQLite3 db.
- Contains capabilities for deployment and has been used with AWS, Ubuntu, Docker, docker-compose, and Nginx to `deploy a WSGI server`.
- Contains APIs to support `user authentication and cookies`, a great deal of which was contributed by Aiden Wu a former student in CSP.  

## Flask Portfolio Starter

Use this project to create a Flask Server.

- GitHub link: [flask](https://github.com/open-coding-society/flask)
- The runtime link is published under the About on the GitHub link.
- `Create a template from this repository` if you plan on making GitHub changes.

## The conventional way to get started

> Quick steps that can be used with MacOS, WSL Ubuntu, or Ubuntu; this uses Python 3.9 or later as a prerequisite.

- Open a Terminal, clone a project and `cd` into the project directory.  Use a `different link` and name for `name` for clone to match your repo.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/openccs; cd ~/opencs

git clone https://github.com/open-coding-ocietyflask.git

cd flask
```

- Install python dependencies for Flask, etc.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Open project in VSCode

- Prepare VSCode and run
  - From Terminal run VSCode

  ```bash
  code .
  ```

  - Open Setting: Ctrl-Shift P or Cmd-Shift
    - Search Python: Select Interpreter.
    - Match interpreter to `which python` from terminal.
    - Shourd be ./venv/bin/python

  - From Extensions Marketplace install `SQLite3 Editor`
    - Open and view SQL database file `instance/volumes/user_management.db`

  - Make a local `.env` file in root of project to contain your secret passwords

  ```shell
  # Reset password for users who forget their password
  DEFAULT_PASSWORD='123Qwerty!'
  # Admin user defaults
  ADMIN_USER='Thomas Edison'
  ADMIN_UID='toby'
  ADMIN_PASSWORD='123Toby!'
  ADMIN_PFP='toby.png'
  # Create a default user for the system
  DEFAULT_USER='Grace Hopper'
  DEFAULT_UID='hop'
  DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD='123Hop!'
  DEFAULT_USER_PFP='hop.png'
  # Obtain key, [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys)
  GEMINI_API_KEY=xxxxx
  GEMINI_SERVER=https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent
  # GitHub Configuation
  GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx
  GITHUB_TARGET_TYPE=user  # Use 'organization' or 'user'
  GITHUB_TARGET_NAME=Open-Coding-Society
  # KASM Configuration (server is defaulted)
  KASM_SERVER=https://kasm.opencodingsociety.com
  KASM_API_KEY_SECRET=xxxx
  KASM_API_KEY=xxx
  # DB Configuration, AWS RDS
  DB_USERNAME='admin'
  DB_PASSWORD='xxxxx'
  ```

  - Make the database and init data.
  
  ```bash
  ./scripts/db_init.py
  ```

  - Explore newly created SQL database
    - Navigate too instance/volumes
    - View/open `user_management.db`
    - Loook at `users` table in viewer

  - Run the Project
    - Select/open `main.py` in VSCode
    - Start with Play button
      - Play button sub option contains Debug
    - Click on loop back address in terminal to launch
      - Output window will contain page to launch http://127.0.0.1:8587
    - Login using your secrets

  - Basic API test
    - [Jokes](http://127.0.0.1:8587/api/jokes)

- Full support for JWT cookies
- The API's for CRUD methods
- The model definition User Class and related tables

#### July 2023

> Updates for 2023 to 2024 school year.

#### January 2023

- The Project entry point is main.py, this enables the Flask Web App and provides the capability to render templates (HTML files)
- The main.py is the  Web Server Gateway Interface, essentially it contains an HTTP route and HTML file relationship.  The Python code constructs WSGI relationships for index, kangaroos, walruses, and hawkers.
- The project structure contains many directories and files.  The template directory (containing HTML files) and static directory (containing JS files) are common standards for HTML coding.  Static files can be pictures and videos, in this project they are mostly javascript backgrounds.
- WSGI templates: index.html, kangaroos.html, ... are aligned with routes in main.py.
- Other templates support WSGI templates.  The base.html template contains common Head, Style, Body, and Script definitions.  WSGI templates often "include" or "extend" these templates.  This is a way to reuse code.
- The VANTA javascript statics (backgrounds) are shown and defaulted in base.html (birds) but are block-replaced as needed in other templates (solar, net, ...)
- The Bootstrap Navbar code is in navbar.html. The base.html code includes navbar.html.  The WSGI html files extend base.html files.  This is a process of management and correlation to optimize code management.  For instance, if the menu changes discovery of navbar.html is easy, one change reflects on all WSGI html files.
- Jinja2 variables usage is to isolate data and allow redefinitions of attributes in templates.  Observe "{% set variable = %}" syntax for definition and "{{ variable }}" for reference.
- The base.html uses a combination of Bootstrap grid styling and custom CSS styling.  Grid styling in observation with the "<Col-3>" markers.  A Bootstrap Grid has a width of 12, thus four "Col-3" markers could fit on a Grid row.
- A key purpose of this project is to embed links to other content.  The "href=" definition embeds hyperlinks into the rendered HTML.  The base.html file shows usage of "href={{github}}", the "{{github}}" is a Jinja2 variable.  Jinja2 variables are pre-processed by Python, a variable swap with value, before being sent to the browser.
